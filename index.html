                        <p>IMPORTANT ACCOUNCEMENT – 17/03/2020</p>
                        <p>Due to the news that British racing is now suspended until the end of April we have taken the decision to freeze all subscription payments with immediate effect.</p>

                        <p>With all that is going on at the moment the last thing you want to be worrying about is paying for services you cannot use.</p>

                        <p>No action is required by you. No further subscription payments will be taken until the racing resumes. If you have any questions about this, please do not hesitate to get in touch via the usual channels.</p>

                        <p>We will keep you up to date with plans as we move forward in these uncertain times. For now, though…please take care of yourselves, and those around you.</p>

                    <p>Just like traders on the stock exchange make money purely from the daily movement in prices, it is now possible to lock-in profits from horse racing without ever having to pick a winner! Even with all the expertise, statistics and experience in the world – making money from betting on horses is a tricky business. Anyone who tells you different is a liar or a fool.</p>
                    <p>The beauty of ‘exchange trading’ is we are simply cashing in on the movement of the odds.</p>
                    <p>Market Movers is a daily service highlighting horse(s) whose prices look certain to shorten before the off.</p>
                    <p>Simply by betting at the early <strong>BIGGER</strong> price means that when the odds <strong>DO</strong> shorten – you are in a position to <strong>LAY</strong> the same horse on the exchanges at the <strong>SHORTER</strong> price. Giving you a profit no matter what happens. Simple…but brilliantly effective!</p>
                    <p class="alert alert-primary"><strong>No winners required. No form to study. No gambling involved.</strong></p>

                    <div class="bar-100 ml-0 mb-3"></div>
                    <p>Members get an email or text message (or both, whatever is most convenient) highlighting the selection(s) for the following days racing. Members are advised to <strong>BACK</strong> the selection(s), preferably with a <strong>Best Odds Guaranteed</strong> bookmaker (* read on to see the benefits). Then, members are advised to <strong>LAY</strong> the same selection(s) on Betfair the following morning – between 09.30 – 10:00 is recommended. </p>
                    <p>And that’s it. So long as the price shortens…<strong>YOU MAKE A PROFIT!</strong></p>
                    <p>Let’s go through the possible scenarios with an example bet…</p>
                    <div class="card card-body step mb-3">
                        <div class="step-circle">
                            Step 1
                        </div>
                        <p class="mb-0">You get your evening email/ text message saying a horse named <strong>MARKET MOVER</strong> is running at <strong>Sandown</strong> at <strong>2.40</strong> tomorrow. It is currently priced at <strong>6/1</strong> but that price is expected to shorten by the time they go to post.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card card-body step ml-3 mb-3">
                        <div class="step-circle">
                            Step 2
                        </div>
                        <p class="mb-0">You decide on a stake you are comfortable with, say £10, and place the bet with a Best Odds Guaranteed bookmaker.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card card-body step ml-3 ml-5">
                        <div class="step-circle">
                            Step 3
                        </div>
                        <p class="mb-0">The next morning you see the price on <strong>MARKET MOVER</strong> has come in from <strong>6/1</strong> to <strong>4/1</strong>. So you <strong>LAY</strong> the same horse for <strong>£10</strong> at <strong>4/1</strong> on Betfair.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>As it turns out, <strong>MARKET MOVER</strong> romps in by ten lengths. So you WIN <strong>£70</strong> from <strong>BACKING</strong> the horse at 6/1 – <strong>£60</strong> profit, plus your <strong> £10</strong> stake back. But LOSE <strong>£40</strong> from <strong>LAYING</strong> the horse at 4/1. Giving you an overall profit of <strong>£20</strong> – your <strong>£60</strong> BACK winnings, minus your <strong>£40</strong> LAY losses.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0"><em>BUT</em>… even if <strong>MARKET MOVER</strong> fell at the first fence, the <strong>£10</strong> stake you lost <strong>BACKING</strong> the horse would be covered by the <strong>£10</strong> you won for <strong>LAYING</strong> the horse.*</p>
                    <p>(*Note: Always take into account the exchange’s commission charges, but these are marginal if your stakes are sensible.)</p>
                    <p>Of course, you have the option to tweak the amount you decide to <strong>LAY</strong> to build ‘Win Win’ profit scenarios. By <strong>‘OVER LAYING‘</strong> you can make a profit whether the selection wins or loses. Using the example above, let’s say you decided to <strong>LAY</strong> the horse for <strong>£12.50</strong> at 4/1 (rather than £10). If <strong>MARKET MOVER WINS</strong>, you would collect the same <strong>£70</strong> from <strong>BACKING</strong> the horse at 6/1 – <strong>£60</strong> profit, plus your <strong>£10</strong> stake back. And <strong>LOSE</strong> a slightly bigger <strong>£50</strong> from <strong>LAYING</strong> the horse at 4/1. Giving you smaller overall profit of <strong>£10</strong>.</p>
                    <p><em>BUT</em>, should <strong>MARKET MOVER</strong> be beaten, the <strong>£12.50</strong> LAY covers your <strong>£10</strong> stake you lost <strong>BACKING</strong> the horse and gives you a <strong>£2.50</strong> profit. So whatever happens in the race, <strong>YOU</strong> are the winner.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-center">The advantage of Best Odds Guaranteed bookmakers</h2>
                    <div class="bar-100 mb-3"></div>
                    <p>The benefit of placing bets with Best Odds Guaranteed (<strong>BOG</strong>) bookmakers means, if after following Step One and Step Two for some reason the odds drift (i.e. get <strong>BIGGER</strong>) you can still make a profit. Because you know that bookmaker will pay out at the <strong>BIGGER</strong> price, you can still cover any potential losses.</p>
                    <p>Let’s go through it using the above example bet…</p>
                    <p>If we assume <strong>Step One</strong> and <strong>Step Two</strong> (above) are exactly the same. BUT, the next morning you find that the price hasn’t shortened – in fact, it has drifted to <strong>8/1</strong>. Normally, this would give you a problem – if the horse <strong>WINS</strong>, you will collect the same <strong>£60</strong> profit. But <strong>LAYING</strong> the horse at 8/1 you stand to <strong>LOSE £80</strong>, giving you an overall <strong>£20</strong> loss. However, because the <strong>BOG</strong> bookie is committed to pay out at the bigger price – you will avoid this situation.</p>
                    <p>Thankfully these instances are very rare but using <strong>BOGs</strong> whenever possible is advised so you are never left high and dry. All our selections are provided by our in-house team of industry experts. Between them they have decades of racing experience and dozens of key contacts – some of whom are the high-net punters and racing owners actually responsible for moving prices. Genuine <em>movers and shakers!</em></p>

                    <div class="single">
                        <p>This is where you can back a horse (i.e. bet to win) with a fixed odds bookmaker, then <strong>LAY</strong> the same horse (i.e. bet to lose) at a <strong>SHORTER</strong> price on the betting exchanges. </p>
                        <p>This creates a ‘Back To Lay Arb’, where subtracting the lay losses from the back winnings leave you an overall profit.</p>

                        <p class="text-uppercase">HOW DOES IT WORK?</p>

                        <p>let’s say there is a horse called Bob’s Lad on offer at 5/1with William Hill. And the same horse is available to Lay at 4/1 with Betfair.</p>
                        <p>So, if we back Bob’s Lad for £50 at 5/1 with William Hill and also lay Bob’s Lad for £50 at 4/1 with Betfair, we can create the following scenario:</p>
                        <ol class="ml-4">
                            <li>If Bob’s Lad wins the race we collect £300 from William Hill<br />
                                (£50 x 5/1 = £250 profit, plus stakes returned)...but we lose £200 on Betfair (£50 x 4/1 = £200 loss)...giving us an overall £50 profit.
                            </li>
                            <li>If Bob’s Lad is beaten we lose £50 to William Hill...but we win £50 from our lay on Betfair...which covers our losses.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>So whatever the outcome of the race…we either make a profit or break even!</p>

                        <p>And it only takes a slight tweak of your stakes to guarantee a profit from both outcomes…</p>

                        <p>Let’s say, we place the same £50 bet on Bob’s Lad to win at 5/1...but this time we lay the horse for £60 on Betfair (instead of £50).</p>
                        <ol class="ml-4">
                            <li>1. If Bob’s Lad wins the race we collect £300 from William Hill<br />
                                (£50 x 5/1 = £250 profit, plus stakes returned)...but we lose £240 on Betfair (£60 x 4/1 = £240 loss)...giving us an overall £10 profit.
                            </li>
                            <li>If Bob’s Lad is beaten we lose £50 to William Hill...but we win £60 from our lay on Betfair...giving us an overall £10 profit.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>A profit no matter who wins the race! <em><strong>You can’t ask for much better than that!</strong></em></p>

                        <p>NOTE: for the ease of explanation Betfair commission is not considered in the examples above.</p>

                        <p>Our unique computer software highlights multiple Back-to-Lay opportunities every day. Doing all the work in the background so you don’t have to. All you have to do is click on to the Back-to-Lay page on the site to see all the day’s runners that are trading shorter on Betfair than with the bookmakers, including the meeting, the race time, the price difference...and highlight the Best Odds Guaranteed (BOG) bookies.</p>

                        <p>Back-to-Lay betting is also a clever way of staying one step ahead of the bookmakers.</p>

                        <p>An occupational hazard of being a regular winner is you will come to the attention of the bookmakers. Some members use Back-to-Lay bets to fool the bookies into thinking they are typical punters...to avoid any unwanted attention of possibility of having their accounts limited.</p>

                        <p>For example, if you’re placing a Back-to-Lay bet like the one outlined above and the horse loses (as in example 2)...although you have your losses covered by winning the lay part of the bet on Betfair...as far as William Hill (or whichever bookmaker you use) are concerned it is a £50 loss.
                        </p>

                        <div class="bar-100 mb-4"></div>
                        <p>By losing with a bookmaker but winning the same amount from Betfair, you are simply transferring your bookmaker winnings into Betfair and keeping you under their radar and away from unwanted attention.</p>

                        <p>You can use our built-in calculator and work out exactly how much you need to stake on each part of the bet...taking into account the Betfair commission. This will help you tailor your stakes if you have a personal feeling about the race outcome.</p>

                        <p>Using BOG bookmakers is also a way to boost your profits! If the horse you back is with a BOG bookmaker and its price drifts out to a bigger price before the off...you will paid at the higher SP...and because you’ve already laid the same horse at lower odds, this can easily DOUBLE or even TRIPLE your profit!
